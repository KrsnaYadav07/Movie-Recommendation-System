# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 dataset. It processes movie metadata like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews to generate a "tags" feature. By vectorizing these tags and computing cosine similarity, it recommends movies similar to a given title.
